## [Chapter 3 - Mostly static pages](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/static_pages)

### [Foreword](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/static_pages#cha-static_pages)
- In this chapter, we will begin developing the professional-grade sample application that will serve as our example throughout the rest of this tutorial.
- Although the sample app will eventually have users, microposts, and a full login and authentication framework, we will begin with a seemingly limited topic: the creation of static pages.
- Despite its apparent simplicity, making static pages is a highly instructive exercise, rich in implications—a perfect start for our nascent application.
Although Rails is designed for making database-backed dynamic websites, it also excels at making the kind of static pages we might make with raw HTML files. In fact, using Rails even for static pages yields a distinct advantage: we can easily add just a small amount of dynamic content.
- In this chapter we’ll get our first taste of automated testing, which will help us be more confident that our code is correct. Moreover, having a good test suite will allow us to refactor our code with confidence, changing its form without changing its function.
